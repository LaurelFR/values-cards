# Values Card Sort

This project is a React SPA built to allow users to complete a personal values card sort online.

## Description

Users can complete a personal values card sort, improving accessibility to a therapeutic activity traditionally done in person. Features include user instructions, the option to add additional values, and a summary to view user results.

## Instructions

The Personal Values Card Sort is intended to help people clarify their own central values and consider how they might reflect those values in their daily lives. The usual procedure is to sort the cards into 3-5 piles based on how important each value is. After the provided values are sorted, users may add additional values. This set provides 3 piles to designate cards:

- **Not Important to Me**
- **Important to Me**
- **Very Important to Me**

To sort a value as "Not Important to Me", users can click the gray button with an 'x'.
To sort a value as "Important to Me", users can click the blue button with one star.
To sort a value as "Very Important to Me", users can click the green button with two stars.
Users may resort any value at any time.

This process can strengthen your understanding of yourself and teach you much about your guiding principles for living.

This Personal Values Card Sort is currently hosted here: [Values Card Sort](https://values-cards.netlify.app)

## Features

- **User instructions** can be found in the top right corner of the page. Once the button is clicked, instructions will pop up to read.

- Users have the option to **add additional values** at the end of the far left "Values Cards" column. Once the button is clicked, a form will appear for users to type in their own value and description and then create the corresponding value card. This card may then be sorted like all other cards.

* The **summary** feature appears at the end of the "Values Cards" column. Once the button is clicked, users can view their all of their sorted values more clearly in a simple three column setup.
