# Values Card Sort

This project is a React SPA built to allow users to complete a personal values card sort online.

## Description

Users can complete a personal values card sort, improving accessibility to a therapeutic activity traditionally done in person. Features include user instructions, the option to add additional values, and a summary to view user results.

## Instructions

The Personal Values Card Sort is intended to help people clarify their own central values and consider how they might reflect those values in their daily lives. The usual procedure is to sort the cards into 3-5 piles based on how important each value is. After the provided values are sorted, users may add additional values. This set provides 3 piles to designate cards:

- Not Important to Me
- Important to Me
- Very Important to Me

This process can strengthen your understanding of yourself and teach you much about your guiding principles for living.

This Personal Values Card Sort is currently hosted here: [Values Card Sort] (https://values-cards.netlify.app)
